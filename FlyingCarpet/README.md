# Flying Carpet

Send and receive files between Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows over ad hoc WiFi. No shared network or cell connection required, just two devices with WiFi chips in close range.

Don't have a flash drive? Don't have access to a wireless network? Need to move a file larger than 2GB between different filesystems but don't want to set up a network share? Try it out!

## Use:

**Linux:** Download the `.AppImage` file from the [releases](https://github.com/spieglt/FlyingCarpet/releases) page for a standalone version, or if you're on a Debian-based distribution, download the `.deb` file and install it with `apk` or `dpkg`.

**macOS:** Download the `.dmg` disk image file from the [releases](https://github.com/spieglt/FlyingCarpet/releases) page. Double-click to mount it and drag the `.app` bundle inside to your Applications folder.

**Windows:** Download the `.msi` installer from the [releases](https://github.com/spieglt/FlyingCarpet/releases) page, or `FlyingCarpet.exe` for a standalone version.

## Compilation Instructions:

+ Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

+ Run `cargo install tauri-cli` to install Tauri.

+ Mac only: Install XCode. Open `FlyingCarpetMac/FlyingCarpetMac/FlyingCarpetMac.xcodeproj` and build it.

+ Run `cargo tauri dev` to run a development version or `cargo tauri build` to create release artifacts.

## Restrictions:

+ Apple devices can only transfer to/from Android, Linux, and Windows as they can no longer programmatically run hotspots. Use AirDrop instead for Apple-to-Apple transfers.

+ Disables your wireless internet connection while in use. (Does not apply to Windows or Android when hosting the hotspot.)

+ macOS sometimes switches back to a wireless network with internet connectivity during particularly long transfers. I haven't been able to replicate this reliably and am not sure if a fix is possible. Please file an issue if you experience this.

+ Flying Carpet should rejoin you to your previous wireless network after a completed or canceled transfer. This may not happen if the program freezes, crashes, or if the windows is closed during operation.

+ Flying Carpet no longer preserves directory structure when sending a folder. This became too complicated once the mobile versions entered the picture. If this feature is desired, please email me at theron@spiegl.dev or file an issue. Or, as a workaround, just zip the directory before sending and unzip on the other device.

## Planned Features

+ Add Flying Carpet shortcut to iOS Share menu.

## Questions That Could Be Asked at Some Point:

+ **Wasn't this a Go repo?** Yes, carcinization has come for the gopher. There were several issues I didn't know how to solve in the Go/Qt paradigm, especially with Windows: not being able to make a single-file executable, needing to Run as Administrator, and having to write the WiFi Direct DLL to a temp folder and link to it at runtime because Go doesn't work with MSVC. Plus it was fun to use `tokio`/`async` and `windows-rs`, with which the Windows networking portions are written. The GUI framework is now Tauri which gives a native experience on all platforms with a very small footprint. The Android version is written in Kotlin and the iOS version in Swift. Neither mobile codebase is in this repository.

+ **You're using SHA-256 to derive the key from a password. Isn't that bad? Shouldn't you be using a Password-Based Key Derivation Function like Scrypt or Argon2?** I was doing this before, but it wasn't strictly necessary because these keys are only used during the file transfer. For an attacker to intercept the data in transit, they'd need to be on the hotspot network, which is protected by WPA2, so they'd need to shoulder-surf the password or QR code. The change was made because I couldn't find a good Scrypt or Argon2 implementation on all platforms.

+ **Why are you using AES-GCM at all if there's already WPA2 then?** When I started working on this project in 2017, I was trying to allow for IBSS WiFi networks on macOS that didn't use authentication. I was using the wrong encryption (and incorrectly) then, and later I added AES-GCM because it's the only good and official-ish AEAD implementation I could find in all of Go, Swift, Kotlin, and now Rust. If any cryptographers read this and find that I'm still being dumb, please let me know.

## Questions for Hypothetical Users:

+ Did anyone use the CLI version? Is there need for one now? With the original Go version, I wrote the CLI first and then learned how to make a GUI. For this version, with Tauri requiring Tokio, the async stuff is pretty deeply hooked in, so it didn't make sense to do the CLI first. It may be relatively straightforward to make a CLI version, but I might not do so unless people will use it. Please let me know: theron@spiegl.dev.
